# GarbageClassification
Our project aims to create a garbage classification system using the EfficientNet architecture. By utilizing a comprehensive dataset, we plan to develop models that can automate waste segregation. This step is crucial for enhancing recycling and waste management processes, ultimately contributing to environmental conservation.
